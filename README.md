# Minor Internship Mark de Boer

The repository is divided in 2 sections: ODE and ABM

## ODE 
The non-spatial HIIS framework was directly expanded by implementing a new ODE-driven wound compartment similar to the tissue, liver and blood compartment in the HIIS interface (Figure 2). The novel wound compartment implemented the following biological entities: TGF-β, PDGF, MMP-9, fibroblast and collagen.

## ABM
A proof of concept two-dimensional ABM, simulating the clearing and regeneration of the debris. The proposed ABM interface models the interactions between the endothelial cells, inflammatory cells (neutrophils and macrophages), fibroblasts and their key mediator cytokines and growth factors (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β) under the assumption that a completely regenerated debris can always be achieved.
